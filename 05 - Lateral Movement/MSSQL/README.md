# Custom CLR DLL for SQL Server

We can compile the `CreateAssembly.cs` file with csc.exe:
- `csc.exe /target:library cmd_exec.cs`

Next, we must run these SQL Statements before continue:

```
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa';
use msdb
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options',1
RECONFIGURE
EXEC sp_configure 'clr enabled',1
RECONFIGURE
EXEC sp_configure 'clr strict security', 0
RECONFIGURE
```

Now you should be able to execute OS commands via the ‚Äúcmd_exec‚Äù stored procedure in the ‚Äúmsdb‚Äù database as shown in the example below:

### How Do I Convert My CLR DLL into a Hexadecimal String and Import It Without a File?

If you read Nathan Kirk‚Äôs original blog series, you already know that you don‚Äôt have to reference a physical DLL when importing CLR assemblies into SQL Server. ‚ÄúCREATE ASSEMBLY‚Äù will also accept a hexadecimal string representation of a CLR DLL file. Below is a PowerShell script example showing how to convert your ‚Äúcmd_exec.dll‚Äù file into a TSQL command that can be used to create the assembly without a physical file reference.

- Use the `Convert-toHex.ps1` to convert your DLL to pure TSQL, If everything went smoothly, the `c:\temp\cmd_exec.txt` file should contain the following TSQL commands. In the example, the hexadecimal string has been truncated, but yours should be much longer. üòâ
